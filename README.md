# Physics Toys
Ever wanted to toy around with physics (with your friends or alone) on your Minecraft Server?
But you also didn't want to install anything on the client?
Then this mod is ideal for you!

Physics Toys adds few items that allow you to move and destroy things with power of "realistic" physics!
You can also kill things with it!

While it is mostly designed to be used in creative, but it works in survival (including some recipes).
